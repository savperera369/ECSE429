2. As a user, I want to get details of a specific project by ID so that I can review its information and status.

3. As a user, I want to create a new project without needing to specify an ID so that I can quickly add projects without managing unique identifiers.

4. As a user, I want to update details of an existing project by its ID so that I can ensure the project information is accurate.

5. As a user, I want to delete a specific project by ID so that I can remove completed or irrelevant projects from the system.
